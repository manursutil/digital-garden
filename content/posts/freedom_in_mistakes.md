For four years I studied medicine. It’s a strange thing to say now, because in many ways it feels like a different life. Medicine demands a certain kind of mind: disciplined, systematic, comfortable with memorization and rigid hierarchies. I admired my classmates who thrived in that world, but I never felt at home.

The only times I felt fully alive were in the simulation exams. There, medicine became a kind of game. You had to think on your feet, adapt, make quick decisions with incomplete information. It felt like play, it was messy and unpredictable. The rest of it, though, was endless memorization. I could barely hold my attention for twenty minutes before drifting. It wasn’t just hard for me; it felt alien.

I still remember speaking with the dean of the faculty when I was deciding whether to drop out. He told me that medicine was “easy” compared to difficult majors like maths, engineering or computer science because it was all memorization. You don't really need to understand, just retain for the exam and you're done, that's what he said to me. But for me, that was exactly the problem. I liked math precisely because it asked you to understand. To wrestle with ideas, to follow reasoning, to find clarity in structure. Ironically, hearing him say that only made me more sure of my decision. If this was what medicine valued, memorization over understanding, then I knew I was in the wrong place.

Dropping out was both terrifying and liberating. I didn’t have a clear plan, only a sense that I needed something else, something that allowed me to be myself. That’s when I found coding. At first it was just Python scripts, small automations, toy projects. But there was something intoxicating about it: you write a few lines, and something happens. You make a mistake, and instead of punishment, the program teaches you. You tweak, you rerun, you learn by doing.

Coding gave me what medicine never could: freedom. Freedom to explore without asking permission. Freedom to make mistakes and treat them as lessons, not failures. Freedom to thrive in messy structure, where things don’t always go according to plan but something valuable still emerges.

Data science became the natural path. It combined my analytical side with this newfound playfulness. I wasn’t memorizing anymore; I was discovering, questioning, experimenting. I could use numbers to tell stories, to reflect on the world. Code and data gave me a language where I could both analyze and create.

What I’ve realized is that programming isn’t just technical. It’s existential. It’s not just about loops and functions, but about the freedom to build your own path instead of following someone else’s. Medicine always felt like walking a road laid out centuries ago. Coding feels like stepping into a field and drawing your own lines.

And here’s the irony: coding, something you do with a machine, feels far more human (to me) than medicine ever did. To be human is to make mistakes, to fail, to learn and try again. That’s what code demands of you. You write something, it breaks, you fix it, and in that cycle you grow. Medicine, or at least the way it’s taught, was the opposite. Endless memorization, rigid procedures, no space for error, even though you are supposed to be dealing with humans, in practice it often felt robotic.

There’s a strange reversal here. With code, the machine becomes a partner in your humanity. With medicine, humans were turned into machines. Maybe that’s why, for me, programming feels like the more human discipline. It accepts imperfection. It thrives on iteration. It mirrors life.

That’s why even the simplest projects a snake slithering across a terminal, a flock of simulated birds, cells flickering in Conway’s universe, matter so much to me. They’re not just exercises in logic. They’re reminders that in choosing this path, I chose something closer to what it means to be human.
