Welcome to my **Digital Garden**.

This is a place where I will capture interesting and **\*\*raw\*\*** thoughts, ideas, quotes and projects I come up with in my day to day life.

If you aren't aware of the concept of a digital garden, let me put you up to date. It's a blend between a personal blog, wiki and and a lab experiment for ideas and thoughts. It is essentially a collection of notes, and other forms of writing, organized by date. It resembles a garden because some ideas, like plants, you need to take care of them, let \***\*grow\*\*** and harvest. If they don't grow, you throw them out and learn from them. So ideas, like plants, are in \***\*constant evolution\*\***.

I chose one of my favorites gardens as an image for this post, Claude Monet's garden in Giverny, France. If you haven't checked out his \***\*Water Lilies\*\*** collection already, i recommend researching it online or, if you're lucky enough, go see them at the \***\*Mus√©e de l'Orangerie\*\*** in Paris.
